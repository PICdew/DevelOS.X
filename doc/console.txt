The DevelOS Console

1. Overview

The console inside DevelOS servers multiple purposes.
It acts as text buffer for attached displays. they need to be double buffered to avoid changing of the content while the 
display is rewritten.
It is planned that this will also serve as buffer for UART communication and as debugging tool. in a debug session, you can 
watch the global variable console.Buffer and see the output from the OS, even if the display fails for some reason. 
It will also recieve data from the input modules and provide unified Input to the OS. Furthermore, this module will 
contain a command handler that allows execution of commands from a serial console. It is not finished though. For now, it just has the internal text buffer and the routines for writing to this buffer.

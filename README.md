# DevelOS
An OS for Microchip PIC MCUs.

It is designed to be tiny but powerfull. 
Almost everything is modular, so it can be fitted to any project.

There are drivers for some common hardware, like HD44780/KS0073 LCD-Displays.
Other modules exist for internal peripherals, like EEPROM, ADC and so on.
Some modules are purely software, like the RTC.
